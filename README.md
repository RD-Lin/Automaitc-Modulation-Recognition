# Automaitc-Modulation-Recognition
deep learning models used for signal modulation recognition
This repository implements models mentioned in "Fast Deep Learning for Automatic Modulation" whith pytorch.
In this implementation, we obtained comparable performance to results reported in paper.

lib requirements:
pytorch
numpy
scikit-learn
